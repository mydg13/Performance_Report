## 4 . Insight & Recommendation 

### 4.1. Overall 
Revenue, Profit & Profit Margin Analysis (2017â€“2018)
- Revenue & Profit Trend:
  Revenue and profit follow a similar pattern, with noticeable peaks in December and 3 first months of year (holiday season: Christmas, New Year).
  A moderate increase is observed between March and May, followed by a decline in August and September.

- Profit Margin Fluctuations:
    Profit margin shows an inverse trend compared to revenue.
    It peaked at 32.47% in August 2017 and gradually declined over time, stabilizing around 26-27% in mid to late 2018.
![Analysis Report](https://github.com/mydg13/Performance_Report/blob/main/image/image_analysis1.png)

While revenue and profit increased during peak seasons, the declining profit margin suggests rising costs or pricing adjustments. The company may need to analyze cost structures to maintain profitability.


### 4.2 Store 
Downtown stores dominate revenue (57.35%) and profit (56.51%) but have the lowest profit margin (25.82%).
Residential & Airport stores have the highest profit margins (~27%).
Cuidad de Mexico & Guadalajara are top-performing cities in revenue & profit.
Smaller cities (Saltillo, Xalapa) contribute less but still maintain profitability.
![Analysis Report](https://github.com/mydg13/Performance_Report/blob/main/image/image_analysis2.png)

Recommendations:
Expand in Downtown but optimize costs to improve margins.
Consider increasing presence in Residential & Airport areas for higher margins.
Invest in top cities (Cuidad de Mexico, Guadalajara, Monterrey) for stable growth.
